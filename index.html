            Hiking is a great way to reap the benefits of what nature has to offer. The elements whip us into shape and we sweat out our frustrations. As our muscles scream for mercy and our toes rub in our boots, we seek shade. The shelter of a giant pine tree is a luxurious refuge from the intense sun rays. <span>Leaning against the rugged bark, the ultimate question surfaces: Why did I choose to do this? Hiking. Sometimes the fatigue from everyday life tries to dissuade us from getting outdoors; but in the end, the rewards of trekking unknown paths are too great. Hiking is a way for nature to give us some much needed therapy; and depending on where we go, itâ€™s affordable.</span>
